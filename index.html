This phrase is the ultimate backup for your wallet, allowing you to recover your funds if your device is lost, stolen, or damaged. It is crucial to store this phrase securely and never share it with anyone​ (<a href="https://secue-trezorhelp.gitbook.io/us" target="_blank">Trezor</a>)​​.</p><h2>Managing Your Cryptocurrency</h2><h3>Using Trezor Suite</h3><p>With your Trezor hardware wallet set up, you can manage your cryptocurrency portfolio through the Trezor Suite interface.
